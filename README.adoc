== Overview

This tutorial walks you through on how to build a Java functions on a Function as a Service(FaaS) platform
 https://openwhisk.apache.org/[Apache OpenWhisk].

== Prerequisites

You will need in this tutorial

=== Tools
* {uri-minishift}[minishift]
* https://www.docker.com/docker-mac[docker]
* https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-kubectl-binary-via-curl[kubectl]
* oc (eval $(minishift oc-env))
* https://maven.apache.org[Apache Maven]
* stern (brew install stern)
* {uri-openwhisk-cli}[OpenWhisk CLI]
* curl, gunzip, tar are built-in to MacOS or part of your bash shell
* git (everybody needs the git CLI)
* Java 8

=== Setup minishift
Local development and testing can be done using https://github.com/minishift/minishift[minishift].  Minishift is a tool that helps you run
 OpenShift locally by running a single-node OpenShift cluster inside a VM.  Details on minishift and installation procedures can be found
 https://docs.openshift.org/latest/minishift/getting-started/index.html[here].

==== Minishift Profile Setup

[source,sh,subs=attributes+]
----

#!/bin/bash

# Don't foget to add the location of minishift executable to PATH

minishift profile set faas-tutorial
minishift config set memory 8GB
minishift config set cpus 3
minishift config set image-caching true
minishift addon enable admin-user
minishift addon enable anyuid {conum-guard-sh} # <1>

minishift start

minishift ssh -- sudo ip link set docker0 promisc on {conum-guard-sh} # <2>
----

<1> Some images that are in Apache OpenWhisk Docker hub requires __anyuid__ SCC in OpenShift
<2> This is needed for pods to communicate with each other within the cluster (TODO: need to add more clear details here)

[IMPORTANT]
====
`minishift ssh -- sudo ip link set docker0 promisc on` command needs to be execute each and every time minishift restarted
====

=== Setup environment

[source,sh,subs=attributes+]
----
#!/bin/bash

eval $(minishift oc-env) && eval $(minishift docker-env)
oc login $(minishift ip):8443 -u admin -p admin
----

[[setup-openwhisk]]
=== Setup OpenWhisk

The project {uri-openwhisk-openshift}[OpenWhisk on OpenShift] provides the OpenShift templates required to deploy Apache OpenWhisk.

[source,sh,subs=attributes+]
----
oc new-project faas {conum-guard-sh} # <1>
oc project -q {conum-guard-sh} # <2>
oc process -f https://git.io/openwhisk-template | oc create -f - {conum-guard-sh} # <3>
oc adm policy add-role-to-user admin developer -n faas {conum-guard-sh} # <4>
----

<1> Its always better to group certain class of applications, create a new OpenShift project called `faas` to deploy all OpenWhisk applications
<2> Make sure we are in right project
<3> Deploy OpenWhisk applications to `openwhisk` project
<4> (**Optional**) Add `developer` user as admin to `faas` project so as to allow you to login with developer user and access `faas` project

[NOTE]
====
You need to wait for sometime to have all the required OpenWhisk pods come up and the FaaS is ready for some load. You can watch the
status using watch -n 5 'oc logs -f controller-0 -n faas | grep "invoker status changed"'
====

==== Verify Deployment

Launch OpenShift console via `minishift console`.  Navigate to the `faas` project by clicking the name in the upper right corner.  A
successful deployment will look like:

image::readme_images/ow_deployed_success_1.png[OpenWhisk Pods]
image::readme_images/ow_deployed_success_2.png[OpenWhisk Pods]

[[configure-wsk]]
==== Configure WSK CLI

Download {uri-openwhisk-cli}[OpenWhisk CLI] and add it your PATH.  Verify your path using the command
`wsk --help`

The {uri-openwhisk-cli}[OpenWhisk CLI] needs to be configured to know where the OpenWhisk is located
and the authorization that could be used to invoke `wsk` commands.  Run the following command to have that setup:

[source,sh,subs=attributes+]
----
#!/bin/bash

AUTH_SECRET=$(oc get secret whisk.auth -o yaml | grep "system:" | awk '{print $2}' | base64 --decode)
wsk property set --auth $AUTH_SECRET --apihost $(oc get route/openwhisk --template="{{.spec.host}}")
----

Successful setup of WSK CLI will show output like:

image::readme_images/ow_wsk_cli_setup.png[WSK CLI]

In this case the OpenWhisk API Host is pointing to the local minishift nip.io address

To verify if wsk CLI is configured properly run `wsk -i action list`.  This will list some actions which are installed as part of the
OpenWhisk setup.  If you see empty result, please see <<install-catalog>>

[TIP]
====
The `nginx` in OpenWhisk deployment uses a self-signed certificate.  To avoid certificate errors when using `wsk`, you need to add `wsk -i`
to each of your `wsk` commands. For convenience, you can add an alias to your profile with `alias wsk='wsk -i $@'`.
==== 

=== Setup your Development environment

Clone the complete project from `git clone {uri-repo}`, we will refer to this location as $PROJECT_HOME through out the document for convenience.

=== Integration with External Applications

The real use of functions is its ability to listen to external world events and fire themselves when such events happens. In this section we will see how to integrate Functions with external world applications. For the demo sake we will making our Functions integrated with Slack. This integration stripped down version of the OpenWhisk demo app available at https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/openwhisk-slackapp[openwhisk-slackapp].

== Troubleshooting
[[install-catalog]]
=== Reinstall default Catalog

If you are on a low bandwidth sometimes the default catalog will not be populated, run the following commands to have them installed
[source,sh,subs=attributes+]
----
#!/bin/bash

oc delete job install-catalog <1>

cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: install-catalog
spec:
  activeDeadlineSeconds: 600
  template:
    metadata:
      name: install-catalog
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: catalog
        image: projectodd/whisk_catalog:openshift-latest
        env:
          - name: "WHISK_CLI_VERSION"
            valueFrom:
              configMapKeyRef:
                name: whisk.config
                key: whisk_cli_version_tag
          - name: "WHISK_AUTH"
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: whisk.auth
                key: system
          - name: "WHISK_API_HOST_NAME"
            value: "http://controller:8080"
      initContainers:
      - name: wait-for-controller
        image: busybox
        command: ['sh', '-c', 'until wget -T 5 --spider http://controller:8080/ping; do echo waiting for controller; sleep 2; done;']
      restartPolicy: Never
EOF {conum-guard-sh} <2>
----

<1> Delete the old job
<2> Run the install-catalog job again 

Now when you run `wsk -i action list` you should see output like:

image::readme_images/ow_install_catalog.png[Install Catalog]

[[tips-and-tricks]]
== Tips and Tricks

[TIP]
====
* If you are going to use a lot of `wsk` then its worth aliasing wsk with `alias wsk='wsk -i $@'` to avoid SSL errors and skip adding `-i`
for every command.
* For detailed JSON output form `wsk` commands prefix `-v`.  This is a great command option for troubleshooting.
* Its safe to use `wsk -i update [resource]` when creating OpenWhisk resources like **Actions**, **Packages** etc., as this command 
will act like `create` for new resources and `update` for existing resources.
* `wsk -i [resource command ] --summary`  provides detailed information about a specific resource e.g. wsk -i action get foo --summary
* `wsk -i activation poll`, a very useful command when we want to debug some error or see the exception stack traces during a function execution.  The simple example of this could be that we star this command on one terminal and fire the action on another to see  poll window showing exceptions/errors/stacktraces if any during execution.
